 * \brief This file contains SHA-1 definitions and functions.
 *
 * The Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) cryptographic hash function is defined in
 * <em>FIPS 180-4: Secure Hash Standard (SHS)</em>.
 *
 * \warning   SHA-1 is considered a weak message digest and its use constitutes
 *            a security risk. We recommend considering stronger message
 *            digests instead.
